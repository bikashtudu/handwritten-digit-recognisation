## Introduction
In this project we have developed deep learning model to recognise hand written digits.

### MNIST Dataset
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. These images were normalized in size and centered. Each image is in a 28x28 square (784 pixels). 60,000 images were used to train a model and 10,000 were used to test it.

## Multilayer Perceptrons Model:-
We have used 28x28(784 pixels) in input layer and different hidden layers with different activation such as Relu, Sigmoid and Softmax.


## Conclusion:-
We have tired all the combination of activation function and we found that our accuracy is around 98% and Relu-Softmax combination  has given the min error rate.
